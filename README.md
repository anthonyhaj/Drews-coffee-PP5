## Deployment
### AWS S3 Bucket Setup 

To set up an AWS S3 bucket:

## Amazon WebServices
1. Create an account at aws.amazon.com
2. Open the S3 application and create an S3 bucket named "scubasport"
3. Uncheck the "Block All Public access setting"
4. In the Properties section, navigate to the "Static Website Hosting" section and click edit
5. Enable the setting, and set the index.html and the error.html values
6. In the Permissions section, click edit on the CORS configuration and set the correct configuration
7. In the permissions section, click edit on the bucket policy and generate and set correct configuration
8. In the permissions section, click edit on the Access control list(ACL)
9. Set Read access for the Bucket ACL for Everyone(Public Access)
10. The bucket is created, the next step is to open the IAM application to set up access
11. Create a new user group named "manage-scubasport"
12. Add the "AmazonS3FullAccess" policy permission for the user group
13. Go to "Policies" and click "Create New Policy"
14. Click "Import Managed Policy" and select "AmazonS3FullAccess" > Click 'Import'.
15. In the JSON editor, update the policy "Resource"
16. Give the policy a name and click "Create Policy"
17. Add the newly created policy to the user group
18. Go to Users and create a new user
19. Add the user to the user group
20. Select "Programmatic access" for the access type
21. Note the AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY and AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID variables, they are used in other parts of this README for local deployment and Heroku setup
22. The user is now created with the correct user group and policy
23. Note the AWS code in settings.py. Note an environment variable called USE_AWS must be set to use these settings, otherwise it will use local storage
24. These settings set up a cache policy, set the bucket name, and the environment variables AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY that you set in your aws account
25. The configuration also requires the media/static folders that must be setup in the AWS S3 bucket to store the media and static files 

### Stripe Endpoint

1. Register for an account at stripe.com
2. Click on the Developers section of your account once logged in
3. Under Developers, click on the API keys section
4. Note the values for the publishable and secret keys
5. In your local environment(env.py) and heroku, create environment variables STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY and STRIPE_SECRET_KEY with the publishable and secret key values

<br><code>os.environ.setdefault('STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY', 'YOUR_VALUE_GOES_HERE')</code>
<br><code>os.environ.setdefault('STRIPE_SECRET_KEY', 'YOUR_VALUE_GOES_HERE')</code>

6. Back in the Developers section of your stripe account click on Webhooks
7. Create a webhook with the url of your website
9. Note the key created for this webhook
10. In your local environment(env.py) and heroku, create environment variable STRIPE_WH_SECRET with the secret values
<code>os.environ.setdefault('STRIPE_WH_SECRET', 'YOUR_VALUE_GOES_HERE')</code>

11. Feel free to test out the webhook and note the success/fail attempts for troubleshooting

### Heroku  

[Official Page](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git) (Ctrl + click)

This application has been deployed from Github using Heroku. Here's how:

1. Create an account at heroku.com
<details><summary>See Images</summary>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArronBeale/CI_PP4_the_diplomat/main/docs/heroku/heroku-deployment-01.PNG">
</details>

2. Create an app, give it a name for such as ci-pp4-the-diplomat, and select a region
<details><summary>See Images</summary>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArronBeale/CI_PP4_the_diplomat/main/docs/heroku/heroku-deployment-03.PNG">
</details>

3. Under resources search for postgres, and add a Postgres database to the app
<details><summary>See Images</summary>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArronBeale/CI_PP4_the_diplomat/main/docs/heroku/heroku-deployment-04.PNG">
</details>

Heroku Postgres

1. Note the DATABASE_URL, this can be set as an environment variable in Heroku and your local deployment(env.py)
2. Install the plugins dj-database-url and psycopg2-binary.
3. Run pip3 freeze > requirements.txt so both are added to the requirements.txt file
4. Create a Procfile with the text: web: gunicorn the_diplomat.wsgi
5. In the settings.py ensure the connection is to the Heroku postgres database, no indentation if you are not using a seperate test database.
6. Ensure debug is set to false in the settings.py file
7. Add localhost, and ci-pp4-the-diplomat.herokuapp.com to the ALLOWED_HOSTS variable in settings.py
8. Run "python3 manage.py showmigrations" to check the status of the migrations
9. Run "python3 manage.py migrate" to migrate the database
10. Run "python3 manage.py createsuperuser" to create a super/admin user
11. Run "python3 manage.py loaddata categories.json" on the categories file in products/fixtures to create the categories
12. Run "python3 manage.py loaddata products.json" on the products file in products/fixtures to create the products
13. Install gunicorn and add it to the requirements.txt file using the command pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
14. Disable collectstatic in Heroku before any code is pushed using the command heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1
15. Ensure the following environment variables are set in Heroku
16. Connect the app to GitHub, and enable automatic deploys from main if you wish
17. Click deploy to deploy your application to Heroku for the first time
18. Click on the link provided to access the application
19. If you encounter any issues accessing the build logs is a good way to troubleshoot the issue
